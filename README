NGoM-Evacuation-Route-Inundation
    These scripts are used to examine inundation under future sea level rise scenarios during 100-year flood events. The script utilizes the NCCOS Ecological Effects of Sea Level Rise in the Northern Gulf of Mexico (EESLR-NGOM)dataset (currently available at: https://data.nodc.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/iso?id=gov.noaa.nodc:170340) and Homeland Infrastructure Foudation-Level Data (HIFLD) Hurricane Evacuation Routes file (currently available at: https://hifld-geoplatform.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/hurricane-evacuation-routes)
